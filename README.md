# SAR-RSI-bot-script-deployment--telegram

Hi

In this Repostitory I have made a bot strategy script which will helps in executing orders to FTX exchange automatically.

The script that i have uploaded has achieved good accuracy and will perform in Cryptocurrency markets.

- config.py file stores all the personal information like API, Secret keys. 

- sar_rsi.py file contains the whole code which will not only just execute order but it will also helps in deployment using Flask application.

- Also made a Telegram bot in sar-rsi.py which will send the order summary to the telegram group automatically. 

- Before running the script take a look at it, if you want to change asset and amount of the orders. Also initially I have set the initail position to False, so if you are already in position before just change the in position = True in config.py

Below are the information regarding the indicators that i have used in this strategy :-

RSI indicator - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp

I have also backtest this strategy using my own backtesting framework and done hyperoptimization.

Results and history of trades are stored in Backtesting results folder, passed BTC and ETH asset on 1 year and 6 month time frames.
